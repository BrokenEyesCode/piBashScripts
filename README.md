# piBashScripts
This is a selecton of scripts that I have found useful on my pi.

# sysInfo.sh
A quick and dirty bash script I put together to gather stats for my pi

# updateTime.sh
A simple script to keep the clock updated, you need to have ntp installed, it isns't as standard!

# backupCCTV.sh
I used motioneye,so this script merges the video content and tar's up all the files into an archive folder then deletes them, I run this just after midnight to back up the previous day.

# lastImage.sh
A script that will capture the last image recorded by motion eye, as the current application doesn't work correctly.
